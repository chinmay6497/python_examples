# The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle C, along
# with their frequencies.
# Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and
# displays the noteâ€™s frequency. Your program should support all of the notes listed
# previously.
# Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously you
# should add support for all of the notes from C0 to C8. While this could be done by
# adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is cumbersome,
# inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise. Instead, you should
# exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular, the frequency
# of any note in octave n is half the frequency of the corresponding note in octave n+1.
# By using this relationship, you should be able to add support for the additional notes
# without adding additional cases to your if statement.
