#  Tuple can store any data like list
# tuple are immutable

f=('one',2,3.1)
# print(f)
#  Here we cannot insert,append ,pop or remove data from tuple

#  It is used where the data is not going to change example day ie: monday,tuesday
# Tuple are faster comparision to list
# 
# Method which is used in tuple are
# Count
# Index
# len function
# slicing

#  Looping in tuple
# for i in f:
#     print(i)

# Tuple with one element
f1=("1")
# print(type(f1))

f2='apple','mango',['mango','banana']
f2[2].pop()
print(f2)
# print(type(f2))

#  Unpacking of Tuple
fruits='apple','mango'
fruit1,fruit2=fruits
# print(fruit1)
